# AIDA — AI Included Disclosure Acknowledgment

This project includes contributions generated with the help of AI tools. All AI-assisted content was reviewed and edited by the author.

## Human-Authored

* Core cryptographic logic and algorithms
* Keygen / sign / verify implementations
* Mathematical routines and overall architecture
* Project design, structure, and security-relevant code

## AI-Assisted

* Debugging small bugs and error messages
* Writing some pytest tests
* Parts of the FastAPI backend for the Web UI
* HTML/CSS for the Web UI
* AIDA.md itself

## Summary

AI was used only for supporting tasks (tests, UI, boilerplate, debugging).
All cryptographic and security-critical logic was written by hand.
